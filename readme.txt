Galen Otten, Final Project
CS 5001, Spring 2021
My Mastermind explained
'''

    Thank you for playing my version of MasterMind! It will
have four unique colors in the secret code. The leaderboard should display at
most ten leaders with the highest scores recorded. If a leader gets knocked off
the display board, they will still be in the leaderboard file, so they can 
climb back up if they beat a player currently on the board.

    This was my very first project I completed in my CS studies. I used OOD, MVC, and
the Turtle library to create this game.
